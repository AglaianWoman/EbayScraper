# EbayScraper

Small project to help me find a phone on ebay without signing into the Developer API.

## How it works

Takes a base search page in a format for a URL, and seeks out any items in that list below a price specified. You must do all the filtering in the Ebay search prior to passing the URL to this script.

## Note

Currently hardcoded for the S8, requires updating to suit taking different URLs, Items and Prices as variables. Will be done as a seperate branch
